# Baby Food Analyzer

A web application that analyzes baby food ingredients to determine if they're healthy for babies aged 1-3 years.

## How the Frontend Services Work Together

The React frontend uses two service modules to communicate with the MCP server:

- **`analysisService.ts`**: Handles the initial ingredient analysis. When a user uploads or captures an image, the frontend extracts the text and calls `analyzeIngredients` from this service, which sends a POST request to the MCP server's `/analyze` endpoint. The server returns the analysis result.

- **`mcpService.ts`**: Handles saving analysis results and fetching analysis history. After receiving the analysis result, the frontend calls `saveAnalysisResult` to persist it (via the `/save` endpoint), and uses `fetchAnalysisHistory` to retrieve past results (via the `/history` endpoint).

```
[Browser/React App]
     |
     |  (calls analyzeIngredients in analysisService.ts)
     v
[analysisService.ts]  --HTTP-->  [MCP Server (server.js) on :3001]
     ^
     |  (calls saveAnalysisResult, fetchAnalysisHistory in mcpService.ts)
     |
[mcpService.ts]  --HTTP-->  [MCP Server (server.js) on :3001]
```

**The server never calls these services directlyâ€”they are HTTP clients used by the frontend.**

    participant U as User (Browser)
    participant F as React App
    participant A as analysisService.ts
    participant M as mcpService.ts
    participant S as MCP Server (server.js)

    U->>F: Uploads or captures image
    F->>A: Calls analyzeIngredients (ingredient text, profile)
    A->>S: POST /analyze
    S-->>A: Returns analysis result
    A-->>F: Returns result
    F->>M: Calls saveAnalysisResult (result)
    M->>S: POST /save
    S-->>M: Confirms save
    F->>M: Calls fetchAnalysisHistory
    M->>S: GET /history
    S-->>M: Returns history
    M-->>F: Returns history
    F-->>U: Updates UI
```
